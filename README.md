# Reinforcement-Learning-CVRP
The Dynamic Attention Model built here is inspired from the paper by Peng on the topic A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Using Dynamic Attention Model for Vehicle Routing Problems found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03282)

Special thanks to d-eremeev for writing complete code for this paper and making it public. His code can be found in the github repo [here](https://github.com/d-eremeev/ADM-VRP), without his help and support it would be impossible  for me to complete this project.
